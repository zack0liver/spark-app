# Spark — Enhancements

## Planned

### ~~Hidden view on swipe right~~ (Done — Timeline River implemented)

### Combine timeline river and browse cards into one view
- **Description**: Replace the separate browse (card list) and timeline (river) views with a single unified view. The timeline river is the preferred layout — explore merging the card-style details (source icon, delete button) into the timeline cards, then dropping the browse view to simplify to two panels: capture + timeline.
